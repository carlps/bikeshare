Classes. AKA Models.
x- probably should just send data into model
x- and do all unpacking + MD5 in there.
x- as_list should be class method instead of attr?
    --it will save space and processing so yes.

datasets:
x- system_regions
x- station_information
    x-test update/delete and should be good
!- station_status
    x- full load
    !!- cdc/stream load
    x- view (max last_updated group by ID)
        SELECT MAX(last_updated), station_id, ...
        FROM station_status
        GROUP BY station_id

X fix set_station_md5

X- control table
    x-change start/end to decimal
!- unit tests
!- rollback on error


in models.__init__ can you make import * import *.*?
    ex: instead of from models.system_regions import System_Region, etc
        would rather just from models import *

sqlalchemy?
--will do one after sqlite and compare

station status might be better for mongodb?


X-python 3.6

What happens when I, D, and then new? Probably a new I, right?

tests:
-insert on empty db
-compare IUD
-empty file
-views are correct

make a utils lib with things like:
    def backup_file(file):
        '''
        makes a copy of file with .bkp appended to filename in current working dir
        '''
        fname = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),file)
        fname_bkp = f'{fname}.bkp'
        return shutil.copyfile(fname,fname_bkp)
