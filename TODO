TODO

Classes. AKA Models.
x- probably should just send data into model
x- and do all unpacking + MD5 in there.
x- as_list should be class method instead of attr?
    --it will save space and processing so yes.

datasets:
x- system_regions
x- station_information
    x-test update/delete and should be good
-- station_status

X fix set_station_md5

!- control table
!- unit tests


sqlalchemy?
--will do one after sqlite and compare

station status might be better for mongodb?


X-python 3.6?

What happens when I, D, and then new? Probably a new I, right?

tests:
-insert on empty db
-compare IUD
-empty file
-views are correct




station_info
1 - 888 should be D
2 - 1 should be I
3 - 100 should be U

regions
1 - 123 D
2 - 42 U
3 - 104 I
