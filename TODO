postgres
    - load failing?
    - create test db






tests:
-insert on empty db
-compare IUD
-empty file
-views are correct
-all deletes?
-can get data and create obj

*args, **kwargs?

What happens when I, D, and then new? Probably a new I, right?



station status might be better for mongodb?



make a utils lib with things like:
    def backup_file(file):
        '''
        makes a copy of file with .bkp appended to filename in current working dir
        '''
        fname = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),file)
        fname_bkp = f'{fname}.bkp'
        return shutil.copyfile(fname,fname_bkp)

    get_data(dataset) returning json for dataset could be good
