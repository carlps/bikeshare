run.py file which runs bikeshare_etl for specific set, cdc, etc.

X models all in one file models.py
    x-can remove to_lists?
    x-metadata class?
    x-maybe a parent class (like Record?) that has base attributes? (to clean: if model==...)
        x-maybe parent dimension or dim?
        x-parent set_md5
        --class like Latest_System_Region(System_Region): __tablename__ = 'view'

-insert on empty db
-compare IUD

make a utils lib with things like:
    def backup_file(file):
        '''
        makes a copy of file with .bkp appended to filename in current working dir
        '''
        fname = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),file)
        fname_bkp = f'{fname}.bkp'
        return shutil.copyfile(fname,fname_bkp)
