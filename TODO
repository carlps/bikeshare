TODO

Classes. AKA Models.
x- probably should just send data into model
x- and do all unpacking + MD5 in there.
x- as_list should be class method instead of attr?
    --it will save space and processing so yes.

datasets:
x- system_regions
-- station_information
-- station_status

sqlalchemy?
--will do one after sqlite and compare

station status might be better for mongodb?


python 3.6?
